## MVC Project

A project to learn about the MVC architecture. It's like this:

- **M = Model**: The code that manages the database.
- **V = View**: The layout, which shows data and can call the controllers.
- **C = Controller**: The part in the middle between View and Model; it controls the communication between them.
